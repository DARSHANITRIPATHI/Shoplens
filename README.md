Design Decisions
React for Frontend: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, making it easy to manage UI changes and reuse components across the app.
Express.js for Backend: Express provides simplicity and scalability, making it an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs.
CSS for Styling: A responsive design was created using CSS to ensure the app works on all screen sizes.

Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Making the design responsive
Solution: I used CSS media queries to adjust layouts based on screen size and ensure the app is responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Challenge 2: API Integration and Error Handling
Solution: I implemented try-catch blocks to handle errors during API calls and proper validation to ensure the application handles edge cases.
